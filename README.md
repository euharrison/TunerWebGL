## Description

This is an experiment that happened on SuperLab, Rio de Janeiro.  
The main objective is to begin to learn the power of WebGL.

Here you can fine tune your musical instrument.  
If it is tuneful, it will appear the correspondent signal in green, if it is out of tune, it will appear in red and noisy.

Remember that it is an experiment and just for fun, do not use it as a professional tuner.

Enjoy.
